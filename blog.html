    <p>
        Use var when you want a variable to be function-scoped or when working with older code.</br>
        Prefer let for variables that need to be block-scoped and may be reassigned.</br>
        Use const for variables that need to be block-scoped and should not be reassigned after initialization.
    </p>

    <p>
        null:<br>
        Explicitly Set Absence: Developers can use null to explicitly set a variable or object property to indicate the
        absence of a value.</br>
        undefined:</br>

        REST API
        which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is an
        architectural style for designing networked applications. It is a set of principles that define how web
        standards, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), should be used to create web services. RESTful APIs are
        designed to be simple, scalable, and stateless, making them well-suited for use in distributed systems and the
        web
